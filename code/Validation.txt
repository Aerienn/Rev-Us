Validation is put on input box and stuff right?
I'm not sure how it goes but here is a sample of what I think could be.

1. Max character length is 500. The model isn't currently good enough for multi sentiment classification so making this limit is better.

2. User cannot press predict button when there isn't enough input (i.e they just put a white space, numbers and stuff). This isn't a high priority one but just in case they ask for it.


Example code for validation logic check in python:
if not user_input or user_input.isspace():
    raise ValueError("Input cannot be empty or contain only whitespace")
elif user_input.isnumeric():
    raise ValueError("Input should be text, not numeric")

def test_type_error(test_case,data):
for review in data:
    with test_case.subTest(review=review):
        with test_case.assertRaises(TypeError):
            predict_sentiment(review)

def test_empty_reviews(self):
    empty_cases = [
            "",       # Empty review
            "   ",    # Whitespace-only
    ]
    test_type_error(self, empty_cases)

def test_numerical_reviews(self):
    numeric_cases = [
            '23',4324,    # Integer
    ]
    test_type_error(self, numeric_cases)
